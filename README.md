### Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to accomplish this projec t:

- ReactJS
- Axios
- React-router-dom
- Styled Components
- TMDB API

### Author's Notes

- Kept it simple to demonstrate how I can make a call to an API and utilize the data received. Another reason is to demonstrate basic CRUD operations.

- Currently not responsive to smaller devices due to the fact that this is suppose to be a dashboard and will remain that way. Plan to recreate this using **Flutter** as a separate app.
